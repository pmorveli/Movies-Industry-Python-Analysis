# Movies-Industry-Python-Analysis
A collection of files related to the Movie's Industry.

There's a CSV file that contains the dataset that I worked on. This dataset is a public one that I got from Kaggle, the URL is: https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies

The other file is a python one where all the code is. Basically what I did was to first clean and preprocess the data, that included giving every value of each column the same format, filling the blanks or deleting rowsa and/or columns.

Then, I performed a small statistical analysis on the data to see if there was any correlation between variables that would explain the gross income of a movie.

Finally I performed an exploratory analysis on the data, trying to find trends on it, regarding directors, budget, genre, etc.

The libraries I used for this project were numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. I wrote the whole code on Jupyter Notebooks.
